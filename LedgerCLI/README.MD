## Code Highlight

The application allows users to search past transactions by vendor name through the **Reports Menu**.

This feature reads all transactions from the `Transactions.csv` file and lets the user enter a search term to filter matching vendors.

Example Output

```java
public void searchByVendor() {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter vendor name to search: ");
    String vendorSearch = scanner.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase();

    for (Transactions tx : transactionsList) {
        if (tx.getVendor().toLowerCase().contains(vendorSearch)) {
            tx.displayTransaction();
        }
    }
}
```
