# Accounting Ledger

## Description
This is my first capstone from learn to code academy. It is a Command-Line-Interface(CLI) project that 
tracks transactions for the user. In this application the user can add deposits, record payments, and generate a ledger report filtered
by type, vendor, date range, or price range. All transactions are saved into a CSV file.

Demonstrates usage of Java development skills like file handling, user input usage, and CLI navigation.


## Features

- Record payments (debits)
- View full ledger (newest first)
- Filter by Deposits or Payments
- Generate Reports:
  - Month-to-date
  - Previous month
  - Year-to-date

  - Search transactions by Vendor
- (Optional) Custom search across multiple fields
